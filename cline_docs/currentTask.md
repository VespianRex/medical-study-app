## Current Objective
- Start building the medical study app based on the provided SRS document (`srs.md`).

## Context
- The `srs.md` document outlines the design and workflow for the medical study app.
- The app will process Romanian medical content, extract key information, and generate study materials.
- The workflow emphasizes speed in the initial steps to engage users, with more advanced processing occurring in the background.

## Next Steps
- Focus on initial processing and user engagement as outlined in `srs.md`.
- Implement the file upload functionality in the frontend (basic form implemented).
- Add drag-and-drop functionality to the file upload (implemented).
- Implement the backend endpoint to handle file uploads.
- The frontend now sends the uploaded file to the backend `/upload` endpoint.
- The backend server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
- Test the file upload functionality from the frontend.
- The frontend is open in the browser.
- Set up a virtual environment (venv) for the backend.
- Uninstall packages from the main Python directory and install them in the venv.
- Start following Test Driven Development (TDD).
