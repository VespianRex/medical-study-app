# Final Reflection Questions

Below are the questions raised during the design process, organized by context:

### 1. User Engagement and Initial Processing

- **How can we make the upload process even more user-friendly and reduce perceived wait times?**
  - Could we implement drag-and-drop functionality, instant previews, or placeholder content while processing occurs?

- **Are there other data points (e.g., visual content previews or term clusters) we could show at this stage to keep users engaged?**
  - Perhaps display word clouds of frequent terms or thumbnail previews of extracted images.

- **Should users be allowed to skip deeper processing entirely if they find the quick insights sufficient?**
  - Offering a "Quick Study" mode might cater to users needing immediate information.

### 2. Data Extraction and Glossary Building

- **Should we prioritize certain terms (e.g., most frequent or user-marked as important) for enrichment first?**
  - Prioritizing could improve efficiency and user satisfaction by focusing on high-value content.

- **Would users benefit from seeing an outline of these chunks for review or customization?**
  - Allowing users to adjust the segmentation might improve relevance and personalization.

- **Should we make the knowledge graph editable or keep it static based on system-generated relationships?**
  - Editable graphs could enhance learning but may require safeguards to maintain accuracy.

### 3. Flashcard Generation and User Interaction

- **Should users have the ability to customize flashcard templates or formats?**
  - Customization can cater to different learning styles but might complicate the interface.

- **Would splitting the dashboard into "Quick Access" and "Deep Dive" modes make it easier for users?**
  - This could help users navigate depending on their immediate needs or time constraints.

- **Should feedback collection be passive (clicks, skips) or active (explicit ratings)?**
  - Combining both methods might provide comprehensive insights without overwhelming users.

### 4. Verification and Accuracy

- **How can we further reduce the time for the initial quick insights step without compromising accuracy?**
  - Optimizing algorithms and possibly caching frequent operations could help.

- **Should low-confidence results be hidden until verified, or should users decide whether to view them?**
  - Providing an option to view all results with confidence indicators may balance transparency and caution.

- **How can we balance speed versus accuracy in the verification process for real-time results?**
  - Implementing asynchronous processing and prioritizing critical data checks can maintain performance.

### 5. Advanced Features and Enhancements

- **Should we implement multi-tiered confidence scores (e.g., one for retrieval, one for generation)?**
  - Multi-tiered scores can provide granular insight but might confuse users if not presented clearly.

- **Should users be able to click on citations for detailed source information?**
  - Interactive citations enhance transparency and trust but require careful UI integration.

- **Should the trust layer (confidence indicators) be interactive, allowing users to view detailed validation steps?**
  - This could benefit advanced users seeking deeper understanding of the content's reliability.

- **Would a tiered summary system (e.g., 1-sentence, 1-paragraph, full summary) improve usability?**
  - Offering summaries at different levels can cater to varying user preferences and time availability.

### 6. Feedback and Continuous Improvement

- **Should feedback updates from multiple users automatically trigger system updates, or require manual approval?**
  - Automatic updates improve responsiveness but may risk quality without oversight.

- **Should we integrate AI-driven improvement suggestions based on aggregated user feedback?**
  - AI can identify patterns and propose enhancements, streamlining the improvement process.

- **Should there be a reward system for users who contribute high-quality feedback?**
  - Incentives might increase engagement but require a fair and motivating reward structure.

### 7. Technical Implementation

- **Should local models serve as fallback only, or do they have a primary role in specific contexts (e.g., offline or privacy-sensitive data)?**
  - Defining clear roles for local models can optimize performance and address privacy concerns.

- **Should we prioritize depth (e.g., more enriched data) or breadth (e.g., covering as many terms as possible)?**
  - Balancing both may provide comprehensive coverage without sacrificing quality.

- **How do we ensure the knowledge graph remains performant as it grows in size and complexity?**
  - Implementing efficient data structures and regular maintenance can maintain performance.

### 8. User Experience and Accessibility

- **Should we allow collaborative editing of the knowledge graph or glossary?**
  - Collaboration can enhance learning but requires mechanisms to prevent misinformation.

- **Are there additional workflows (e.g., exporting flashcards, collaborative study tools) that would add value to the platform?**
  - Integrations with existing study tools (e.g., Anki) and collaborative features might enhance utility.

- **How can we make traceability (source links, process logs) user-friendly without overwhelming users with information?**
  - Providing summaries with the option to delve deeper can cater to diverse user needs.
